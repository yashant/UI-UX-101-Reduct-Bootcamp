            The last page did not follow the following design priciples. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Intuitive Design
        </h4>
        <!-- <img class="img-small" src="door.png" alt = "push/pull door handle">
       -->  <p>    
            Good designs are intuitive. It is a bad UX pratice to slow down the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            DON'T make the user think or look for cues to perform basic tasks.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Design Vocabulary
        </h4>
        <p class="tab">
            Every user comes with a common design vocabulary. 
            Don't make your design "too" different from pre-existing design languange. 
        </p>

        <div class="alignment3">
        <h4>
            Feedbacks
        </h4>
        <p> It is important to alert users that they did something.
            The good use of visual cues to give feedbacks is a good UX practice.

    <h4>Consistency.</h4>
    <p>
        Donâ€™t align related items differently. Be consistent. (Also, adding images here would help the users grasp ideas better).
